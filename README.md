## Hugbot

A Telegram bot that hugs each person in a list of users once every 59 minutes. Written just to be cute to some people that were having a shitty day.

## Usage
- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
- create a `.env` file with two lines, `BOT_TOKEN=your_token` and `STICKER_ID=some_sticker_id`, I used a sticker commissioned from NAL of me hugging you. :3
- `python3 hugbot.py --ids [user_id other_user_id other_other_user_id...]` for as many users as you want
